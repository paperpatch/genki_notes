# Genki Review Notes

This project is a personal collection of review notes and summaries covering various Japanese language learning materials. Originally based on the Genki I & II textbooks, it has since expanded to include additional resources such as kanji lists, travel-related vocabulary, and more. It serves as a structured reference for reinforcing key concepts, grammar points, and vocabulary.

While this is primarily a personal study aid, I hope it can also be useful to others reviewing similar materials.
