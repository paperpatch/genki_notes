# Genki Review Notes

This page serves as a personal review and summary of what I’ve learned from the Genki I & II textbooks. It’s designed to help me reinforce key concepts and grammar points while providing a quick reference for future study. While this is a personal resource, I hope it can also be useful for others who are revisiting or reviewing the material.
