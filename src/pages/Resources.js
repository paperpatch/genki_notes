            Q: What resources do you recommend for learning Japanese?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A: I recommend using textbooks like Genki for grammar, apps like Anki
          for flashcards, and online resources like YouTube. The key is to stay
          consistent and practice regularly.
